			<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>
			<p>
				Hi, I’m Rachanont, thanks for stopping by!</p>

<p>Here’s a list of what I am currently working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a dad and husband, I try to keep my "work" hours to a manageable 35-40 hours a week.</li>
<li>Blogging here mostly in Thai, but hey, every now and then, I mix it up with some English!</li>
<li>I am currently employed as a retail pharmacist while also practicing law part-time.</li>
<li>Reading, Running, and Coding.</li>
<li>Being Apetimism holder and Jigsaw fam</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my priorities and I’m not looking to be involved in any new projects at this time.</p>

<p>The NowNowNow project by Derek is awesome.</p>

If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page. Last updated Sep 2023.

(Great idea, borrowed from <a href="https://sivers.org/now">Derek Sivers</a>)

				This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
				<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
				<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like
				Tailwind, React, or Vue to your project.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/pages/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
