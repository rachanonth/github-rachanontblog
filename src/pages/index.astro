			<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>
			<p>Updated September 8th, 2023, from my home in Pattaya, Thailand.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of what I am currently working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a dad and husband, I try to keep my "work" hours to a manageable 35-40 hours a week.</li>
<li>Blogging here mostly in Thai, but hey, every now and then, I mix it up with some English!</li>
<li>I am currently employed as a retail pharmacist while also practicing law part-time.</li>
<li>Reading, Running, and Coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my priorities and I’m not looking to be involved in any new projects at this time. (Great idea, borrowed from <a href="https://sivers.org/now">Derek Sivers</a>)</p>
